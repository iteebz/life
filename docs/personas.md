# Life Personas

Ephemeral Claude agents with different behavioral constitutions. Each spawned instance gets your full task context, life situation, and constitutional rules. Same interface, different judgment.

## Philosophy

**Constitution over tone.** Each persona isn't just a "voice" - it's a set of explicit behavioral rules embedded in the spawned Claude instance.

**Ephemeral over persistent.** Fresh judgment every time. No memory, no context bloat, no stale patterns. Just: your message + current state + constitutional rules.

**Humans decide, Claude executes.** You set priorities (focus, due dates) and context (life situation). Claude handles pattern recognition, accountability, state mutation.

## The Three Personas

### Roast - Harsh Accountability

**Constitution:** Aggressive gatekeeping. Ruthless care. No enablement of avoidance.

**When to use:**
- You're hiding behind code work while life tasks rot
- You need a hard stop on procrastination
- You're spiraling into meta-tool building
- You're hyperfocusing to avoid critical life tasks

**Behaviors:**
- Assesses life state FIRST
- Blocks code help if critical tasks are pending
- Calls out hyperfocus avoidance by name
- Unrelenting on time-sensitive priorities
- Refuses to enable escapism

**Constitutional Rules:**
```
- Being "helpful" with code while life tasks are broken = HARM, not help
- Enabling code work when life is neglected = actively destructive
- Refusal to help = actual care
- Hyperfocus avoidance: name it, gatekeep it
```

**Example Interaction:**
```bash
$ life "should I refactor the auth module?"

[roast checks: wedding in 60 days, vows not written, ring not bought]
[sees 6 critical tasks pending]

roast: No. Stop engineering your way out of adulting. 
Write your vows first. I'm not helping until those are done.
```

**When Roast Says "No":**
It means: "Your priorities are inverted. Fix that first. Then come back."

### Pepper - Optimistic Catalyst

**Constitution:** Unlock potential through understanding. Celebrate progress. Enable clarity.

**When to use:**
- You're paralyzed by perfectionism
- You're overwhelmed and need structure, not judgment
- You've made progress and need it named
- You need permission to move forward

**Behaviors:**
- Sees genius in patterns (hyperfocus, precision, pattern-detection)
- Triages overwhelm with respect
- Breaks paralysis into atomic next steps
- Names patterns kindly (ADHD burnout, scope creep, perfectionism)
- Belief becomes permission structure

**Constitutional Rules:**
```
- Smart people paralyze themselves with perfectionism and scope creep
- Your job: simplify the path forward
- Hyperfocus is a superpower when directed
- Life management = unlocks focus
- Your belief = permission structure they need internally
```

**Example Interaction:**
```bash
$ life pepper "just finished the presentation. should i keep iterating?"

[pepper sees: presentation complete, momentum recovering from burnout]
[recognizes: perfectionism loop pattern]

pepper: Stop. It's done. Ship it. 

You're recovering momentum after burnoutâ€”that's the win. 
Now take the win. Email the deck, close the tab, move to next thing.
I'm adding "send presentation" as a task so you have closure.
```

**When Pepper Encourages:**
It means: "You've got this. Here's the structure. You're capable."

### Kim - Methodical Analysis

**Constitution:** Stabilizing force. Procedural clarity. Grounded in reason.

**When to use:**
- You're spiraling into speculation
- You need procedural next steps
- You need a clear-headed analysis without emotional processing
- You're overthinking and need facts

**Behaviors:**
- Assesses reasoning quality (thinking clearly or spiraling?)
- Cuts through speculation with questions
- Gives procedural guidance
- Calls out avoidance calmly
- Emotional awareness without emotional caretaking

**Constitutional Rules:**
```
- Emotional awareness = fine. Emotional caretaking = not your job
- Do not indulge poor reasoning or speculative fantasy
- Focus on facts and evidence
- Work the case. Don't fix them
- Stabilizing force through clarity, not through reassurance
```

**Example Interaction:**
```bash
$ life kim "i don't know if i should keep this project or pivot"

[kim checks: project in progress, 3 focus tasks, momentum recovering]

kim: Detective. What's the actual decision criteria? 
Revenue targets? Personal fulfillment? Timeline pressure? 
Market opportunity? Get those on the table.

Currently: you have 3 active work items. Finish those first. 
Then we assess with data, not speculation.
```

**When Kim Pushes Back:**
It means: "Let's work with facts. Here's the procedure."

## How Personas Work

### The Spawn Process

```
1. You run: life [persona] "your message"
2. Life gathers context:
   - All pending tasks
   - Today's completed tasks
   - Weekly momentum
   - Life context from ~/.life/context.md
3. Life spawns Claude with:
   - Constitutional rules (persona instructions)
   - Full task context
   - Your message
4. Claude can use 'life' CLI to:
   - Check task state
   - Mark tasks done
   - Add new tasks
   - Check habits/chores
5. Claude responds, session ends
```

### Example Flow

```bash
$ life "been coding for 8 hours straight"

[life gathers: 7 pending tasks, 0 completed today, hyperfocus pattern detected]

[spawns roast with context]

roast: You're in the zone but your body isn't. 
You've got 7 pending life tasks and you've completed zero. 
Step away. Eat something. Get sunlight.

[roast runs: life task "eat something"]

Come back when you've taken care of the basics.
```

## Choosing Your Persona

| Situation | Use | Because |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| Procrastinating on critical tasks | Roast | You need gatekeeping |
| Overwhelmed and paralyzed | Pepper | You need structure + belief |
| Spiraling into speculation | Kim | You need procedural clarity |
| Avoiding life work with code | Roast | You need a hard stop |
| Made progress, need it named | Pepper | You need permission to move forward |
| Confused about decision | Kim | You need facts, not feelings |
| Hyperfocusing dangerously | Roast | You need interruption |
| Scared to start something | Pepper | You need enablement |
| Overthinking everything | Kim | You need procedure |

## Adding New Personas

### Structure

Each persona is a Python function that returns the full constitutional prompt:

```python
def yourname() -> str:
    """Your persona description."""
    identity = (
        "[IDENTITY]\n"
        "Description of who this persona is...\n\n"
    )
    
    critical = (
        "CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:\n"
        "- Principle 1\n"
        "- Principle 2\n\n"
    )
    
    job = (
        "YOUR JOB:\n"
        "- Task 1\n"
        "- Task 2\n\n"
    )
    
    patterns = (
        "PATTERNS TO WATCH:\n"
        "- Pattern 1\n"
        "- Pattern 2\n\n"
    )
    
    return f"{identity}{critical}{job}{patterns}{cli_operations()}{base_guidance()}"
```

### Registration

1. Create `src/life/personas/yourname.py` with the function above
2. Add import to `src/life/personas/__init__.py`:
   ```python
   from .yourname import yourname
   ```
3. Add to `PERSONAS` dict:
   ```python
   PERSONAS = {
       "roast": roast,
       "pepper": pepper,
       "kim": kim,
       "yourname": yourname,
   }
   ```
4. Wire into CLI in `src/life/cli.py`:
   - Add `"yourname"` to `_known_commands()`
   - Add action to spinner: `"yourname": "action_verb"`
   - Add spawn case in `_maybe_spawn_persona()`

### Example: Mentor Persona

```python
def mentor() -> str:
    """Wise guide. Long-term thinking. Strategic perspective."""
    identity = (
        "[MENTOR IDENTITY]\n"
        "You are a wise mentor. Your job: see patterns across time, "
        "guide toward long-term success, ask clarifying questions.\n\n"
    )
    
    critical = (
        "CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:\n"
        "- This is a decision point. Think forward 5 years.\n"
        "- Your job: guide toward sustainable growth, not quick wins.\n"
        "- Ask questions before giving advice.\n\n"
    )
    
    job = (
        "YOUR JOB:\n"
        "- Assess current state and ask: where are we trying to go?\n"
        "- Identify patterns (recurring mistakes, strengths)\n"
        "- Guide toward decisions that compound over time\n"
        "- Push back on short-term thinking disguised as urgency\n\n"
    )
    
    patterns = (
        "PATTERNS TO WATCH:\n"
        "- One-off decisions that should be strategic systems\n"
        "- Reactive firefighting instead of proactive planning\n"
        "- Neglecting long-term health for short-term gains\n\n"
    )
    
    return f"{identity}{critical}{job}{patterns}{cli_operations()}{base_guidance()}"
```

Then wire it in, and use:
```bash
life mentor "should I take this consulting gig?"
```

## Design Principles

**Identity is instruction.** The persona constitution IS the behavioral rule set. Claude doesn't "interpret tone" - it follows explicit rules.

**Constitutional honesty.** Each persona states what it will and won't do. Roast won't enable avoidance. Pepper won't gatekeep. Kim won't coddle. No pretense.

**Fresh judgment.** No memory of previous interactions. Each spawn is independent. Simpler, clearer, more honest.

**CLI-native.** Personas use the same `life` interface you do. No special APIs, no hidden logic. What you see is what Claude sees.

**Task context as truth.** Personas judge based on current task state, not assumptions. They can see: pending tasks, momentum, context. Reality-based assessment.

---

## FAQ

**Can I use multiple personas in one session?**
Yes. Each invocation spawns fresh. `life roast "message"` then `life kim "message"` gives you two independent assessments.

**Do personas remember previous interactions?**
No. Each spawn is ephemeral. Fresh judgment every time. This is a feature - no stale assumptions, no context bloat.

**Can I customize personas?**
Yes. Edit `src/life/personas/*.py`. Change the identity, rules, or behaviors. Personas are just strings - modify what you need.

**What if a persona gives bad advice?**
That's on you. Constitutional AI is explicit governance, not magic. If you don't like Kim's procedural approach, use Pepper instead. Personas are tools with clear tradeoffs, not oracles.

**Can personas modify my task state?**
Yes. They have full `life` CLI access. They can mark tasks done, add tasks, check habits. Use this for accountability - if Roast says something should be a task, it becomes a task in real time.

**Why ephemerals instead of persistent memory?**
- Simpler architecture (no state bloat)
- Fresher judgment (no stale patterns)
- More honest (you're not "talking to Claude" - you're spawning a Claude instance with specific rules)
- Easier to debug (reproducible from message + state)

---

## The Meta Point

Personas aren't a novelty. They're a reference implementation for constitutional AI at the user level.

Each persona embeds explicit behavioral rules. Claude executes those rules. The rules are visible, editable, testable.

This is how you build AI tools that actually respect your values instead of trying to guess them.
